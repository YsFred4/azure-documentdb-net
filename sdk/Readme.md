The source code for the .NET SDK will be posted here. There are some things we need to wrap up and some processes that need to be completed before we can open source this SDK. Rest assured, we will post this as soon as we can. 

For now, if you have any issues with the SDK that you would like to raise with us, please just open an issue on this repo so that we can track them.

Thanks,
The DocumentDB Team
